# Survival - a 2D game

Survival is a 2D game, pixeled and written from scracth, no engines.

It aims to be a simple game where you're on the map and try to survive the most you can!

Currently a WIP.

## TODOs and development steps

[x] Render a window
[x] Render a "point" that will be the character
[x] Detect and process key movements (WASD)
[ ] Rendering pixel sprites / map
[ ] Implement simple physics
[ ] Object collision
[ ] Game timer for levels
[ ] Powerups and skills
[ ] Enemys
[ ] Combat skill -> HP, damage, how enemys play

These are not in a particular order, just what I remembered when writing.

The game will not have physics in the sense "jump", "fall" etc. It will be a flat map where you can pretty much run anywhere.
Screen wraps around. Just need to do colision management with the map objects.
